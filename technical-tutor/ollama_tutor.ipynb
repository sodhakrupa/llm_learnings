      "### Java Latest Version\n",
      "\n",
      "As of my knowledge cutoff in December 2023, the latest official release of Java is **Java 17**.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's worth noting that Oracle has announced plans to support Java 16 as the next major release, with a planned release date of **May 2024**. This means that Java 16 will likely be the last major version released before Java 17.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here are some key features and updates in Java 17:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Improved performance**: Java 17 includes several performance optimizations, such as improved garbage collection, better caching, and enhanced support for parallelism.\n",
      "* **New language features**: Java 17 introduces several new language features, including:\n",
      " + **Switch expressions**: A concise way to switch on multiple conditions using a single expression.\n",
      " + **Pattern matching**: Simplifies string pattern matching using regular expressions.\n",
      " + **Functional interfaces**: Allows for more expressive and concise code by defining functional interfaces as lambda expressions or method references.\n",
      "* **Improved security**: Java 17 includes several security-related updates, including:\n",
      " + **Input validation improvements**: Enhances input validation to prevent common web application vulnerabilities.\n",
      " + **Sandboxed environments**: Supports the creation of sandboxed environments for running applications with elevated privileges.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Example Use Case\n",
      "\n",
      "To give you a better idea of how these new features work in practice, here's an example use case:\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "// Java 17 code\n",
      "public class MyClass {\n",
      "    public static void main(String[] args) {\n",
      "        String input = \"Hello World!\";\n",
      "\n",
      "        // Switch expression to match the first non-null character\n",
      "        int index = Arrays.stream(input.split(\"\\\\s+\")).mapToInt(String::length).findFirst().orElse(-1);\n",
      "        System.out.println(\"First non-null character at position \" + index);\n",
      "\n",
      "        // Pattern matching for strings\n",
      "        String pattern = \"^Hello$\";\n",
      "        if (input.startsWith(pattern)) {\n",
      "            System.out.println(\"String matches the pattern\");\n",
      "        } else {\n",
      "            System.out.println(\"String does not match the pattern\");\n",
      "        }\n",
      "    }\n",
      "}\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, we use a switch expression to find the first non-null character in the input string and print its position. We also demonstrate pattern matching using regular expressions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note that this is just a brief overview of the latest features in Java 17. For more information, I recommend checking out the official Oracle documentation or reviewing the language documentation for detailed information on each new feature."
